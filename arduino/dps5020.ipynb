    "# RD Tech DPS5020 Power Supply Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This is some demo code that goes along with [this video](https://youtu.be/BoTV7003glU).\n",
    "\n",
    "It demonstrates some basics of using the Modbus protocol to control\n",
    "an RD Tech DPS5020 power supply, version 1.2. It might work with later versions\n",
    "or other products from them - I'm publishing the code so you can try it out and see!\n",
    "If you're familar with Jupyter Notebooks, you can download and run this file as-is.\n",
    "Otherwise, copy and paste what you want out of the GitHub page into a script or python terminal and \n",
    "play around with it that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "My thought is I should be able to hack something like [Pronterface](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun)\n",
    "to monitor the current/voltage output of ths supply while performing\n",
    "[electrochemical machining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_machining),\n",
    "and then have it step through the G-code to maintain a consistent feed rate and kerf width.\n",
    "Since the resistance that the power supply sees is going to be dependent on the gap, \n",
    "that will affect the output voltage, similar to what you get with a [plasma cutter torch\n",
    "height controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAWTuLad43g). The ability monitor the\n",
    "cutting process would be a major improvement over the proof of concept shown by YouTube user\n",
    "VanDro in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINs7eMw7IQ).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need the `minimalmodbus` Python package, which you can install with `sudo pip install minimalmodbus`\n",
    "on most any Linux system. If your machine is having trouble finding\n",
    "the power supply in `/dev/ttyUSB*` or `/dev/ttyACM*`, see the video for details and try installing the\n",
    "[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide). If you're using Mac or Windows, it's *probably*\n",
    "going to appear at `/dev/tty.usbmodem*` or `COM*`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My test device was an electromagnet that was rated for 24 volts and ~0.5 amps.\n",
    "The intput was from a generic 24 volt DC power supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Here's](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32821185351.html) the item on AliExpress, currently\n",
    "under $70 all-in, and [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nP9Vi6cgzv2zbxJG006256rYkz-R_jBL)\n",
    "is where I found the documentation. (Yes, RD Tech publishes it on their Google Drive.)\n",
    "[Here's](https://rdtech.aliexpress.com/store/923042) their official store for all their other products. \n",
    "I'd recommend only buying from the official store, since knock-offs are pretty common when \n",
    "ordering from Chinese export websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on this supply, see [this teardown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2rvAoO-MIA) \n",
    "from the EEVBlog and his [repair video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwdnGbI5ls8). (Note \n",
    "that the issue with ceramic capacitor has been fixed.) Also, I have an coming video with some\n",
    "tips on assembling it easier. (TODO: add that link when published)"
