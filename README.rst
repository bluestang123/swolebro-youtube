This is just a dumping ground for files related to my `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRMLI3S0AFukV1tzX6Cl2Cw>`_,
which is mostly about workshop projects, CNC machinery, and Arduino stuff right now. Don't expect the files here to make much
(if any) sense without the context provided by the videos.

**If you asked a question on a YouTube page of mine, and I referred you to here, please go to the issues tab up above, first search
for anything that might answer your question. (You'll want to clear the `is:open` filter from the search box before searching.) If
you don't find anything, then submit a new issue. Please include the relevant video link(s) at the bottom of your issue so it's
easier for others to find in the future.**

Videos relating to content in this repo will have permalinks in their descriptions to here. Those permalinks will go to a specific
revision of this repo, and the latest version of it may have additional tweaks/changes to those files. You can check the `git log`
to see changes that were made, and the reasons why.

There's also a chance that files will be removed from this repo and broken out into their own projects, if anything grows so big as
to warrant that. If you don't see a file in the latest revision that was here at some prior point, again, check the `git log`, and
see why it was removed and where it was moved to. If you're looking for 3D printing files in particular, you'll probably find them
over here in `this project <https://github.com/swolebro/caddyshack>`_.

I'll make an attempt at linking the files here back to YouTube as well, but if you're not seeing those links, just go to my
channel and dig around.
